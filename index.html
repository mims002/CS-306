	<div class="Title"> Background / Scenario <br> </div>
	<p class="tab"> <span class="SubTitle">Background: </span> Linus is a student at Dale University. His major at the university is computer science and he is currently in his third year at the school. One of the courses he is currently taking is CS 306 this semester and strives to be the best student possible. Dale University is known for having an excellent computer science department. All of the computer science courses there, including CS 306, are known to be designed to be difficult to ensure that the students that graduate are the best they can be. In addition to this, the university takes the academic integrity of its students very seriously and makes a great effort to prevent any form of academic dishonesty among students.</p>
	<p class="tab"> <span class="SubTitle">Scenario: </span> Linus is a struggling student in professor Mauler’s CS 306 class. A couple days before one of professor Mauler’s exams a flag appeared warning the IT department that someone had been browsing through professor Mauler’s Hercules directories. Jack Smith, a member of the Dale university’s IT department, was working at the time the flag appeared, he immediately notified the university about the suspicious activity and professor Mauler. The following day the university discovered whose account had been browsing through professor Mauler’s Hercules directories, Linus. The university took swift action, instead of trying to solve the issue inhouse they decided to get the police involved and brought up charges against Linus.

	<div class="Title"> Questions Presented </div>
	<p class="tab"> <span class="SubTitle"> Legal Questions: </span><br>
											Was the flag a result of Linus hacking into the Hercules Server?<br>
											If so, should the Dale University have the right access his electronics?<br><br>
								
					<span class="SubTitle"> Supporting Case: </span><br>
											Susie M. Plasters v. Commonwealth of Virginia, Court of Appeals of Virginia 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 473
											(The defendant used a computer in an unauthorized manner to look up personal information and criminal history of other individuals, the intended use of the computer was “displayed the warning that use of any information was limited to criminal justice purposes only”. Similarly, Linus cannot access anyone else’s Hercules account and view or modify their directories.) 
											<br><br>
					<span class="SubTitle"> Opposing Case: </span><br>
											Commonwealth of Virginia v. Jon Michael Honhart, 52 Va. Cir. 156; 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 246

											(Defendant was accused of hacking into a server, so it was the job of the plaintiff to prove that they had enough evidence beyond reasonable doubt to prove the defendant had hacked into the server, “The Commonwealth's burden was to prove that defendant did more than simply halt another's computer; the evidence had to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended his actions to cause a malfunction of another's machine”) 
											<br><br>
					
					<span class="SubTitle"> Ethical Questions:</span><br>
											Is it right to access Linus when he has witnesses who believe he did not do it?<br>
											Was it right for Dale University to point figures to one person?
											<br><br>

					<span class="SubTitle"> Legal Elements </span><br>

											For this case there are two main legal questions raised. The first of these is whether Linus hacked into the Hercules server. This question deals with a potential violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( 18 U.S.C. § 1030),which concerns the improper access of a computer without proper authority and having the intent to cause harm through that access. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act has several factors that the defendant must be proven to have committed to show a violation on the part of the act. These factors are:

	<p class="tab"> For this case there are two main legal questions raised. The first of these is whether Linus hacked into the Hercules server. This question deals with a potential violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( 18 U.S.C. § 1030),which concerns the improper access of a computer without proper authority and having the intent to cause harm through that access. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act has several factors that the defendant must be proven to have committed to show a violation on the part of the act. These factors are:
					<br>
					<ol>
						 <li> Knowingly accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access </li>
						 <li> Intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access </li>
						 <li> Knowingly and with intent to defraud, accessing a protected computer without authorization</li>
						 <li> Hacking into or illegally using a computer to change information, such as grades, work reports, etc (18 U.S.C  § 1030(g))</li>
						 <li> Using someone else’s computer to access personal information with the intent to use such fraudulently (18 U.S.C  § 1030(g))</li>
						 <li> The term "exceeds authorized access” means to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accessor is not entitled so to obtain or alter (18 U.S.C § 1030(e)(6))</li>
					
					</ol>
					<br>
					</p>
	<p class="tab">  The second legal question concerns whether the university has a right to search Linus’ computer. This creates a seventh legal element in the case dealing with search and seizure. The 4th Amendment of the Constitution says that the search and seizure of person’s personal effects can’t be done without a warrant and probable cause. This will require the plaintiff to argue that they have probable cause and should be issued a warrant to search the laptop of the defendant.
