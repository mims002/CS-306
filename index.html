	<div class="Title"> Background / Scenario <br> </div>
	<p class="tab"> <span class="SubTitle">Background: </span> Linus is a student at Dale University. His major at the university is computer science and he is currently in his third year at the school. One of the courses he is currently taking is CS 367 this semester and strives to be the best student possible. Dale University is known for having an excellent computer science department. All of the computer science courses there, including CS 367, are known to be designed to be difficult to ensure that the students that graduate are the best they can be. In addition to this, the university takes the academic integrity of its students very seriously and makes a great effort to prevent any form of academic dishonesty among students. </p>
	<p class="tab"> <span class="SubTitle">Scenario: </span> Linus is a struggling student in professor Mauler’s CS 367 class. A couple days before one of professor Mauler’s exams a flag appeared warning the IT department that someone had been browsing through professor Mauler’s Hercules directories. Jack Smith, a member of the Dale university’s IT department, was working at the time the flag appeared, he immediately notified the university about the suspicious activity and professor Mauler. The following day the university discovered whose account had been browsing through professor Mauler’s Hercules directories, Linus. The university took swift action, instead of trying to solve the issue inhouse they decided to get the police involved and brought up charges against Linus.

	<div class="Title"> Questions Presented </div>
	<p class="tab"> <span class="SubTitle"> Legal Questions: </span><br>
											Was the flag a result of Linus hacking into the Hercules Server?<br>
											If so, should the Dale University have the right access his electronics?<br><br>
								
					<span class="SubTitle"> Supporting Case: </span><br>
											Susie M. Plasters v. Commonwealth of Virginia, Court of Appeals of Virginia 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 473
											(The defendant used a computer in an unauthorized manner to look up personal information and criminal history of other individuals, the intended use of the computer was “displayed the warning that use of any information was limited to criminal justice purposes only”. Similarly, Linus cannot access anyone else’s Hercules account and view or modify their directories.) 
											<br><br>
					<span class="SubTitle"> Opposing Case: </span><br>
											Commonwealth of Virginia v. Jon Michael Honhart, 52 Va. Cir. 156; 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 246

											(Defendant was accused of hacking into a server, so it was the job of the plaintiff to prove that they had enough evidence beyond reasonable doubt to prove the defendant had hacked into the server, “The Commonwealth's burden was to prove that defendant did more than simply halt another's computer; the evidence had to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended his actions to cause a malfunction of another's machine”) 
											<br><br>
					
					<span class="SubTitle"> Ethical Questions:</span><br>
											Is it right to access Linus when he has witnesses who believe he did not do it?<br>
											Was it right for Dale University to point figures to one person?
											<br><br>

					<span class="SubTitle"> Legal Elements </span><br>

											For this case there are two main legal questions raised. The first of these is whether Linus hacked into the Hercules server. This question deals with a potential violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( 18 U.S.C. § 1030),which concerns the improper access of a computer without proper authority and having the intent to cause harm through that access. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act has several factors that the defendant must be proven to have committed to show a violation on the part of the act. These factors are:

	<p class="tab"> For this case there are two main legal questions raised. The first of these is whether Linus hacked into the Hercules server. This question deals with a potential violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( 18 U.S.C. § 1030),which concerns the improper access of a computer without proper authority and having the intent to cause harm through that access. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act has several factors that the defendant must be proven to have committed to show a violation on the part of the act. These factors are:
					<br>
					<ol>
						 <li> Knowingly accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access </li>
						 <li> Intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access </li>
						 <li> Knowingly and with intent to defraud, accessing a protected computer without authorization</li>
						 <li> Hacking into or illegally using a computer to change information, such as grades, work reports, etc (18 U.S.C  § 1030(g))</li>
						 <li> Using someone else’s computer to access personal information with the intent to use such fraudulently (18 U.S.C  § 1030(g))</li>
						 <li> The term "exceeds authorized access” means to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accessor is not entitled so to obtain or alter (18 U.S.C § 1030(e)(6))</li>
					
					</ol>
					<br>
					</p>
	<p class="tab">  The second legal question concerns whether the university has a right to search Linus’ computer. This creates a seventh legal element in the case dealing with search and seizure. The 4th Amendment of the Constitution says that the search and seizure of person’s personal effects can’t be done without a warrant and probable cause. This will require the plaintiff to argue that they have probable cause and should be issued a warrant to search the laptop of the defendant.

	<div class="Title">Detailed Witness Statements</div>
	<p class="tab">  <span class="Title"> Plaintiff Witness: Professor Mauler </span><br>
											I have been teaching college students for around 15 years. I have been nominated for Dale’s Professor of the Year Award many years in a row. I enjoy helping my students during my office hours, where I have seen Linus Williams attend multiple times.
											One day after developing my new exam, I received a notification from IT Services saying there was a disturbance in the Hercules server within my directory. The email with the notification was sent by Jack Smith while he was monitoring the activity on Hercules. I had a midterm exam during the week of the flag happening, and I was planning to upload the grades within the same week. I personally expected the exam to be challenging where the average would be around 60% but the class average ended up being a low 80%. It seems like some of the online grades don’t match up with the physical copies.
											<br><br>
					 <span class="SubTitle"> Secrets (do not disclose unless directly asked, but you may drop a hint to see if the questioner is paying attention): </span><br>
											He’s been receiving medication to help fight again Alzheimer from couple years back, sometimes it’s hard for him to remember some students’ names and their grades.
											<br><br>
					<span class="SubTitle"> Supporting Plaintiffs: </span><br>
											There are some online grades that don’t match with the physical copies
											Average ended being low 80s instead of around 60s

											<br><br>
					<span class="SubTitle"> Supporting Defendants: </span><br>
											
											(Secret) Does not remember the exact grades of the students or their names. 
											<br><br><br>
											
					<span class="Title"> Plaintiff Witness: Jack Smith</span><br>
											
											I have been working in the Information Technology department for over five years. In that time I have consistently been promoted until I became one of the four people who works with the Hercules Servers. On Friday 13th,  I noticed that there was red flag around 9:00 pm, on a professor's account and notified the other people I worked with. After getting the okay from the system administrator, I sent an email to Professor Mauler saying that there had been strange activity happening on his Hercules Account. I only know that after notifying the system administrator there was a student who became a suspect in what appears to have been a breach. 

											<br><br>
											
											
					<span class="SubTitle"> Secrets (do not disclose unless directly asked, but you may drop a hint to see if the questioner is paying attention): </span><br>
											
											Jack has been working on testing the security side of the servers. He has noticed that there is a hole in the security and he has been asking his system administrator if there is something that can be done.
											<br><br>
											The system administrator told him that the security level is too high and that they will bring the issue to the person above him in position. He has not heard back from the system administrator or the other person if the hole has been fixed. 

											<br><br>
					
					<span class="SubTitle">Supporting Plaintiffs: </span><br>
											The servers have had to issue flags in the past and were resolved quickly.<br>
											The previous flags have caught students trying to hack into Hercules.<br>
											Linus’ account had violated the rules by hacking into the servers and gathering information.<br>
											The suspicious activity happened on Professor's Maulers account.  <br>


											<br><br><br>
					
					<span class="Title"> Defendant Witness: Han Khan (part time University server technician) </span><br>
											I’m Linus’s best friend, I’ve known him since high school. I’ve always been the well known computer guy amongst our friend group. Linus and I used to manage a computer science club, we were tasked to manage a private gaming server. Academically Linus is a bright student but he has been struggling this semester. He is a virtuous friend and is always does the right thing.
											<br>
											We try to meet up twice a week, we either workout or play computer games. At the time of the alleged hack we were in the middle of a workout routine, we didn’t finish our workout until 10 pm. After completing our workout we went straight to Mcdonalds for some food; Linus couldn’t have gone home before 12 am.

					<span class="SubTitle"> Secret Information (disclose only if asked, but you may want to drop hints to see if the questioner is paying close attention) </span><br>
											>Linus gave up on some of his classes this semester, Linus recently showed great distress with the University. Han noticed that Linus frequently would try to breach the security of games he played. 
											<br>
											>Linus manages his own forum in a well known gaming community where he posts tutorials on how to use hacking software for popular games. 
											<br>
											>Han took CS367 with Professor Mauler where he received an A when he was supposed to receive C, Han thinks that the professor often forgets things and makes silly mistakes.


											<br><br>
			
					<span class="SubTitle"> Supporting Plaintiff:  </span><br>
											Han accidently mentioned that Linus was struggling academically this semester, and that Linus has mal feeling towards the University. This shows a reasonable motive for Linus to hack into the server. Han also mentioned that Linus has experience in managing a server which shows that Linus possibly has the capability to breach the University server.


											<br><br>
			
					<span class="SubTitle"> Supporting Defendant: </span><br>
											Han provides a solid alibi for Linus. The fact that the time of the alleged flag and him being out with Han overlap gives Linus a strong defense.

					<span class="Title"> Defendant Client Witness: Linus Williams, Dale University student </span><br>
											
										I am a Junior majoring in Computer Science at Dale University. Throughout my academic career at Dale University I have always strived to be on top of my studies for all of my classes. I am enrolled CS 367 class which deals with learning C in the Hercules servers. I have been doing well up until this semester; outcome of this semester is very important to me as it directly impacts my probability of getting an internship that I’ve dreamed of. This particular internship requires skills that is taught in this course. So I attended the professor’s office hours many times, it’s strange that he always refers to me with a wrong name. Anyways, I have noticed that there have been times in the past where the servers would slow down and not save my work. I genuinely believe that the Dale University is mistakenly directing an unreasonable accusation towards me regarding its server issue.  

	
											<br><br>
					<span class="SubTitle"> Secrets (do not disclose unless directly asked, but you may drop a hint to see if the questioner is paying attention): </span><br>
											Linus has had problems with understanding CS 367 materials, and the grades on quizzes and tests averaged around 65. Linus is under a severe depression from receiving low grades this semester.
											<br>
											Linus had previous experience with hacking, hacked into several games in the past. Also has posted videos on Youtube involving tutorials on how to hack into the games. 

											<br><br>
					<span class="SubTitle">Supporting Plaintiffs:  </span><br>
											This semester’s grade is crucial for Linus as he is trying to get his first internship, this shows reasonable motive for him to hack into the Hercules server
											<br>
											(Secret) Linus has the experience to hack into software’s due to having hacked into games before
											Linus took CS306 previously, where he learned about specific legal elements related to CS cases, this shows that Linus knowingly and intently breached the server (if he is proven to have breached the server).

	<div class="Title">Trial Analysis </div>
	<p class="tab">
					
					This portion of the case will provide quick reference material for future graders.  It should include the following:<br><br>

					<span class="SubTitle">   A. Detailed analysis of Plaintiff's arguments.  What does the plaintiff need to prove in order to win, and how can she/he prove it?  This portion should reference all facts contained in any of the witness statements that may help support each of the legal elements of the case, as well as an explanation of which cases from the case bank support the plaintiff's side and how they do so.  Clearly indicate the precedential value of each case.  (You should also make a note of any cases that may SEEM to support the plaintiff's side but that actually fail to so, perhaps because they have been overturned.)   </span><br>
											
											<br>The plaintiff needs that to prove that Linus had knowingly hacked into the Hercules server. Specifically, they need to prove that it was him using his account to conduct the hacking and that he was the one who initialized the attack on the servers. There are several facts contained in the witness statements for this case that can be used to prove the legal elements for the case. The clear evidence of hacking taking place on the server, the flag identifying Linus’ account as the one used to hack the servers. Witness statements potentially indicates Linus’s motive to hack into the Hercules server and change his grade. The fact that Linus took the CS 306 ethics course the previous semester indicates that he had a clear knowledge of how to act ethically, and the fact that Linus would have the necessary skills to conduct the hack on the server all contributes towards Plaintiff side’s chance of winning.
											<br><br>
											The case bank for this scenario also contains several cases that support the plaintiff’s side. The case Susie M. Plasters v. Commonwealth of Virginia can help support the plaintiff because the events of this case are similar to what is happening in the scenario. The defendant in the above case lost due to gaining unauthorized access to a server and improperly accessing private information. This gives the plaintiff’s side a support because it can help them prove the legal elements dealing with intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access. In addition, the precedential status for this case is good which means that it can still be used as a reliable source for the plaintiff’s side in winning this case.
											<br><br>
											The case DiMaio v. Commonwealth can also be used to support the plaintiff. Here, the appellant steals company files from their server after being fired. This helps the plaintiff’s side because it supports the legal element concerning knowingly and with intent to defraud, accessing a protected computer without authorization. The plaintiff for the scenario can use this case to help show that Linus committed a similar action by changing the grades on the Hercules server. This case also has good precedential status which allows it to fully support the defendant’s side.
											<br><br>
											Finally, the case Crystal Gail Ramsey v. Commonwealth of Virginia can be used to help support the plaintiff. Here, a person’s knowledge that they were not permitted to do something was used against them. This supports the legal element concerning knowingly accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access. The plaintiff can use this case to help them with the fact that Linus had taken the CS 306 class and turn it against him. The above case help show that Linus intentionally hacked into the Hercules server to change the grades and knew that it was considered wrong. The precedential status for this case is also good making this a reliable source for the plaintiff’s side to point to

											<br><br>
					<span class="SubTitle"> B. Detailed analysis of Defendant's arguments.  What must the defendant prove to defeat the plaintiff's case, and how can she/he prove it?  This portion should reference all facts contained in any of the witness statements that may defeat any of the legal elements of the case, as well as an explanation of which cases from the case bank support the defense side and how they do so.  Clearly indicate the precedential value of each case.  (You should also make a note of any cases that may SEEM to support the defense side but that actually fail to so, perhaps because they have been overturned.)  =  </span><br>
											<br>
											The defendant, Linus Williams, must prove that he was not able to login to the Hercules server at the time of the flag because he was out with his friend Han Khan at the gym and to eat dinner. Han Khan’s witness statement can prove Linus’s alibi.
											<br><br>
											The defendant side can also bring up the fact that just because Linus’s account was flagged perusing through his professor’s directories doesn’t automatically mean that he was involved in the criminal activity. There can be many reasons as to why or how someone could have gotten access to Linus’s Hercules account. A similar scenario occurred in a Virginia case, Lester v. Allied Concrete Co. The plaintiff in this case only had a photograph and a suspicion that the defendant had hacked into his Facebook account. The court claimed that the plaintiff cannot make such an unreasonable claim without having solid evidence to backup their claim. So there are many parallels between the Linus’s case and the Lester v. Allied Concrete Co. Linus’s lawyers can use this case as a precedent. They can assert that the plaintiff, the University, needs to provide more evidence to support the claim that Linus was behind the hacking of professor Mauler’s Hercules account. This is another case the lawyers can reference.
											<br><br>
											A case the defendant side can use as a precedence with great shepardizing record is Commonwealth of Virginia v. Jon Michael Honhart. This case deals with the possible damages the defendant might have cost the plaintiff. In the end the jury ruled in favor of the defendant, because the plaintiff could not supply enough evidence proving the defendant caused any damages to their machines. Linus’s lawyers can use this as precedent and try to prove that the legal elements of the plaintiff’s side are not true. If the defendant side can plant a seed of doubt in the eyes of the jury or judge, they have a chance of the jury or judge ruling in their favor.

											<br><br>
					<span class="SubTitle"> C. Explain in straightforward English how the overall case is well balanced between the two parties, in terms of likelihood of winning.  Be sure to point out to what extent the balance is dependent upon "secret" facts coming to light.   </span><br>
											<br>
											The Dale University v. Williams case is well balanced because both sides have evidence that can potentially tip the balance of the case in their favor. The plaintiff has clear evidence of someone using Linus’s account to hack into the Hercules server due to the flag and the tampering of student grades. On the other hand, the defendant has a strong alibi and potential evidence to show there could be issues with the server that could have made it seem like Linus hacked into the server. The balance of the case is also dependent on the defendants revealing the plaintiff’s secrets, mainly about the Professor Mauler having Alzheimer. The Alzheimer factor can counter Mauler’s statement that some of the grades have been changed after the time of the alleged flag, proving that Professor Mauler has Alzheimer could invalidate his statement thereby forcing the court to retract it. The case also depends on the plaintiff revealing private information about the defendant side, mainly about Linus having experience hacking into games and uploading hacking tutorials on Youtube and other platforms. Overall, both sides of this case have an equal opportunity to win.
