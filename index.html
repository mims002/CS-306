	<p class="tab"> <span class="SubTitle">Background: </span> Linus is a student at Dale University. His major at the university is computer science and he is currently in his third year at the school. One of the courses he is currently taking is CS 306 this semester and strives to be the best student possible. Dale University is known for having an excellent computer science department. All of the computer science courses there, including CS 306, are known to be designed to be difficult to ensure that the students that graduate are the best they can be. In addition to this, the university takes the academic integrity of its students very seriously and makes a great effort to prevent any form of academic dishonesty among students.</p>
	<p class="tab"> <span class="SubTitle">Scenario: </span> Linus is a struggling student in professor Mauler’s CS 306 class. A couple days before one of professor Mauler’s exams a flag appeared warning the IT department that someone had been browsing through professor Mauler’s Hercules directories. Jack Smith, a member of the Dale university’s IT department, was working at the time the flag appeared, he immediately notified the university about the suspicious activity and professor Mauler. The following day the university discovered whose account had been browsing through professor Mauler’s Hercules directories, Linus. The university took swift action, instead of trying to solve the issue inhouse they decided to get the police involved and brought up charges against Linus.
